# Infino

**Infino** is an open research project exploring the foundations of epistemic AI — systems that don't just simulate language, but *seek to understand* the world. Inspired by ideas from information theory, neuroscience, and philosophy of science, Infino is a toy prototype for an AI that compresses reality, infers causal structure, and actively learns.

> **Goal**: Build an AI that doesn't just *talk about* the world — but *knows* it.

## 🌱 What is Infino?

Infino is not just another machine learning project. It's an attempt to:
- Build agents that reason through compression, not mimicry
- Use **entropy, KL divergence, and MDL** as guiding principles
- Learn simple, causal models of simulated worlds
- Distinguish between *truth*, *belief*, and *plausibility*
- Be a scientist, not just a predictor

---

## 🧠 Architecture (Work in Progress)

- A toy 2D simulated world (balls, ramps, collisions)
- Two agents:
  - **Mimicker**: Predicts future from past, like a tiny language model
  - **Epistemic Agent**: Builds compressed, causal representations of the world
- Visual tools for comparing their generalization, surprise, and compression

---

## 🔧 Installation (TBD)

To be added once dependencies and setup are finalized.

---

## 🧪 Experiments (Planned)

- Bouncing ball physics
- Out-of-distribution generalization
- Measuring surprise, compression gap, and causal graph recovery

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is built in the open — with curiosity and care.  
If you're driven by learning, compression, and understanding, you're welcome here.

## 🌌 Vision

> **Epistemic AI isn't about mimicking text. It's about compressing truth.**

Infino is the first step.
